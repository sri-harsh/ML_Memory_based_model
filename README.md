# Memory Based Model for Assessment of Neural Movements 
• Implemented a machine learning model with optimal delay via Model Order Selection to predict hand motion by testing with
  a range of delays.
• The neural signal data from 196 neurons in the primary motor cortex is used for training this model, the accuracy of the model is ~99%
